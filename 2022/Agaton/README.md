### Summary
Tropical Storm Megi, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Agaton, was a weak but deadly tropical cyclone that impacted the Philippines in April 2022. It was the third tropical depression, and the second tropical storm of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season. Megi originated from an area of convection in the Philippine Sea where it slowly tracked northwestward into the Leyte Gulf where it remained almost stationary, slowly tracking to the east. Megi made two landfalls, one in Calicoan Island in Guiuan, and another in Basey, Samar. It continued to track southwestward and reentered the Philippine Sea before dissipating.
## Damage Summary
Heavy rains and gales led to the sinking of two ships. Major landslides pushed mud over villages in Leyte, burying around 210 houses. As of April 29, 2022, the Philippines' National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) has reported 214 deaths, 132 missing, and 8 injured. The Department of Agriculture estimates worth ₱3.27 billion in agricultural damages, and the Department of Public Works and Highways estimates worth ₱1.45 billion in infrastructural damages, for a total of ₱4.72 billion (US$90.8 million). These currently differ from the damages reported by the NDRRMC, which remain at ₱2.27 billion (US$43.7 million).
